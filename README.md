# RustPlayground
Bob's Playground with Rust. 

Update Feb 18th: mostly following [the official documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

#### Feb 18th
Followed chapter 2 in the book, finished guessing game.

Liked:
- The `mut` keyword which allows me to control whether each individual variable is mutable or not.
- Auto type guessing but I can also manually enforce a datatype (like `let guess: u32`). Similar syntax with 
Apple Swift.
- Pattern matching (likely from Haskell) and I can even do error handling from there!
- And the Cargo - package manager, builder and runner ALL IN ONE!

Disliked:
- Used `::` a lot... my right little finger hurts
- Not necessarily disliked, but sometimes I can walk away without a `;` when there's only one line in a `{}` block 
while adding more lines will generate compiler error.
